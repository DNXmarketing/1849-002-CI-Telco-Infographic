				<h1>Telecommunications at a Crossroads</h1>
				<h2>Why it’s time for telcos to rethink their IT infrastructure.</h2>
			</section>
			<section class="row two">
				<h1>Industry Trends</h1>
				<p>The telecoms industry is being disrupted. Over-the-top (OTT) streaming services such as YouTube and Netflix, and communications apps like WhatsApp, are bypassing traditional networks and competing with network providers for market share. Less agile, traditional telcos—already burdened with inflexible IT infrastructure and by strict regulation—are struggling to keep up.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="row">
				<h1>The Route to Growth</h1>
				<p>To compete, telcos need a solid IT infrastructure on which to build a data-driven, 5G, and streaming content–based network strategy. With 5G, telcos will be able to offer greater speed, lower latency, and better connectivity, and capture, manage, and monetize the huge volumes and different types of customer data they have access to.</p>
				<h2>5G reach by 2025.</h2>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>1.3 billion connections</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<p>40% of the world’s population</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<p>2.7 billion people</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section class="row">
				<h1>Seize the Opportunity</h1>
				<p>Telcos must prepare for the future with agile, cloud-ready IT. Oracle Engineered Systems—including Oracle Exadata, Oracle Database Appliance, Oracle Exadata Cloud at Customer, Oracle Recovery Appliance, and more—provide a robust, cloud-ready IT infrastructure that’s available on premises as well as in the cloud.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="row">
				<h1>Monetize Services with New Technologies</h1>
				<p>Telcos must find ways to monetize rising volumes of data and provide personalized services for customers. Many are using 5G, video, and Internet of Things to innovate their services.</p>
